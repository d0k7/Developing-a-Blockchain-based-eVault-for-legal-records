Overview

The Blockchain-Based E-Vault System is a secure and decentralized platform designed for storing legal records using blockchain technology. This repository contains the codebase and implementation details for the system.

Features

Decentralized Storage: Utilizes IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) for decentralized and immutable storage of legal records. Smart Contracts: Implements Solidity smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain for access control and ownership management. Access Control: Enables users to grant or revoke access to their uploaded records through smart contracts.

Technologies Used

Solidity: Smart contract development for ownership and access control. React: Frontend interface for uploading records and managing access. IPFS: Decentralized storage protocol for hosting uploaded records. Hardhat: Development environment for Ethereum smart contracts.

Setup and Usage

Installation: Clone the repository and install necessary dependencies using npm install.

Configuration: Set up environment variables, obtain API keys for Pinata, and update React components with Pinata API keys.

Running the Application: Start the React application using npm start. Ensure MetaMask is installed and configured for Ethereum interactions.

Interacting with the System: Follow the instructions in the application to upload records, manage access, and utilize MetaMask for Ethereum transactions.
